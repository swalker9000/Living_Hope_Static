       <h2 class="quoteCall">&quot;Train up a child in the way he should go&quot;</h2>
       <p>Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it. – Prov. 22:6 (ESV)</p>
       <p> The children’s ministry of Living Hope Baptist Church exists to glorify God through evangelizing children, encouraging parents, and edifying servants so that the gospel may be spread among our children, families may be supported, and the church may be strengthened. Our aim is to come alongside parents as the primary disciplers of their children to help them in seeing their children know and love Christ.</p>

        <p>We teach our children from the earliest ages the centrality of Christ in all of scripture, walking with them through the Bible to help them see and understand the sinfulness of mankind and the love of God demonstrated in the cross.</p>

        <p>Our children meet every Wednesday night at 7:00pm as well as each Sunday morning at 9:30 for small groups. We also offer unique children’s church during the second half of our main service. We see value in children watching their parents worship and participate in our service, so our children are in our main service until the sermon starts.  We also occasionally have family days where our children are encouraged to remain with their parents for the entire service. Most Sundays, we provide an optional (they are always welcome in the main service if that’s what you desire) age-appropriate lesson and song time during the second half of the service designed to teach our children the truths of the Gospel.</p>

        <p>We also provide nursery care for the entire service for children up to 2 years old.
